Node.js für <a href=\\\"https://www.lieferando.de\\\">lieferando.de</a> gearbeitet. Das Team war fantastisch so fantastisch das ich glaube nie wieder in einem so guten Team zu arbeiten. Auch die Projekte steckten voller Abenteuer und Cutting Edge Technologien. Doch trotz alledem habe ich meinen 9 to 5 Job gekündigt um die Welt zu bereisen und ortsunabhängig zu arbeiten.</p>\\n<blockquote>Cutting Edge Lover & Javascript Enthusiast</blockquote>\\n<p>Warum?\\nDafür gab es Tausende Gründe …\\nEin sehr ausschlaggebender Punkt ist, dass ich schon immer etwas Eigenes machen wollte.\\nAls Angestellter habe ich oft Momente gehabt wie: “Das würde ich anders machen!” oder “Ich glaube nicht, dass diese Strategie erfolgreich sein wird.”.</p>\\n<blockquote>Ich kann kein Produkt umsetzten, an das ich nicht zu 100 % glaube!</blockquote>\\n<p>Des Weitere habe ich das wirklich unglaubliche Glück als Softwareentwickler ortsunabhängig Arbeiten zu können. Also warum sollte ich jeden Tag von 9-18 Uhr im Büro sitzen, wenn ich in stattdessen die Welt bereisen kann. Dieses Privileg nicht zu nutzen wäre doch unglaublich dumm.\\nNatürlich ist nicht alles Gold, was glänzt! Reisen und Arbeiten unter einen Hut zu bekommen ist nicht immer einfach. Nicht funktionierendes WIFI im Hotel ist da noch harmlos …\\nDeshalb möchte ich auf diesem Blog einige meiner gesammelten Erfahrungen teilen.</p>\\n<div class='center-lg'>\\n<iframe src=\\\"http://www.intagme.com/in/?u=dG9uaW1ldXxpbnwxMDB8NXwyfHx5ZXN8NXx1bmRlZmluZWR8eWVz\\\" allowTransparency=\\\"true\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:575px; height: 230px\\\" ></iframe>\\n</div>\\n<h6>Connect</h6>\\n<p><a href='https://www.xing.com/profile/Toni_Meuschke' target='_blank' class='icon fa-xing' title=\\\"Xing\\\"></a>\\n<a href='https://de.linkedin.com/in/tonimeuschke' target='_blank' class='icon fa-linkedin' title=\\\"LinkedIn\\\"></a>\\n<a href='https://github.com/meuschke' target='_blank' class='icon fa-github' title=\\\"Github\\\"></a>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/tonimeu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon fa-instagram\\\" title=\\\"Instagram\\\"></a>\\n<a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q-pt8vxPGWPRaaObv1nn2BpK1gDmqq1YX2RldZgvdFc/viewform\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"icon fa-envelope\\\" title=\\\"E-Mail\\\"></a></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 453 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"About Me\",\"date\":\"2015-05-28T22:40:32.169Z\",\"path\":\"/en/about/\",\"subheadline\":\"Toni Meuschke\",\"image\":\"me.jpg\",\"locale\":\"EN\",\"body\":\"<p>In the last 5 years I worked in Berlin as a JavaScript &amp; Node.js software engineer for <a href=\\\"https://www.lieferando.de\\\">lieferando.de</a>.\\nThe team was incredibly awesome and I think I will never be again in such a great team in my future life.<br>\\nThey have a lot of interesting project and always adventures and a top cutting edge platform.

Für 399 THB gibt es zusätzlich 3GB Datenvolumen.\\nLeider ist es nicht möglich online über <a href=\\\"http://trueiservice.com\\\">trueiservice.com</a> Datenvolumen zu kaufen. Nach Anfrage beim Support hieß es, dass nur thailändische Kreditkarten akzeptiert werden.</p>\\n<p>Zusätzlich bietet True auch WIFI Hotspots an.

Besonders schön ist der Wat Arun (Tempel der Morgendämmerung) &amp; Wat Pho (Tempel des liegenden Buddhas).\\nDer Wat Pho kostet 100 Baht, für die man den 46 m langen liegenden Budda bestaunen kann. Auch der rest der Tempelanlage ist sehr schön.\\nDer Wat Arun liegt auf der anderen Seite des Chaophraya. Dieser besteht aus einem 79 m hohen Turm, den man schon von der anderen Seite des Flusses gut sieht. Besonders nachts erleuchtet der Tempel in seiner vollen Pracht.</p>\\n<h3>Where to eat?</h3>\\n<p>Bangkok bietet Tausende Garküchen an jeder Ecke gibt es etwas Leckeres und Günstiges zum Essen.\\nDie besten findet man angeblich in Chinatown.</p>\\n<p><h5>Garküche an der Soi Ram Butri</h5></p>\\n<div class='row center-sm'>\\n<div class='col-xs-12 col-md-5 '>\\n<img src='./garkueche.jpg' alt='Garkueche in Bangkok - Bohnen, Reis, Blumekohl' title='' />\\n</div>\\n<div class='col-xs-12 col-md-5'>\\n<img src='./garkueche2.jpg' alt='Garkueche in Bangkok - Bohnen, Reis, Tofu' title='' />\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n<h5>ร้านลุง (Lung) <a href=\\\"http://4sq.com/8Dn0KQ\\\" class=\\\"icon fa-foursquare\\\"></a></h5>\\n<p>Besichtigt man den Wat Arun, lohnt es sich ein paar Ecken weiter im Lung zu essen.\\nDort gibt es eine fantastische Noodle Soup!</p>\\n<div class='row center-sm'>\\n<div class='col-xs-12 col-md-5 '>\\n<img src='./lung.jpg' alt='Garkueche in Bangkok - Bohnen, Reis, Blumekohl' title='' />\\n</div>\\n<div class='col-xs-12 col-md-5'>\\n<img src='./thai-essen.jpg' alt='Garkueche in Bangkok - Bohnen, Reis, Tofu' title='' />\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<br/>\\n<h3>Where to go out?</h3>\\n<p>Eine Bar oder einen Club zu finden sollten in Bangkok keine Problem darstellen.\\nAn fast jeder Ecke kann man etwas trinken und auch unter der Woche haben die Clubs auf.\\nEine Liste für der Clubs findet man auf <a href=\\\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/events.aspx?ai=67\\\">Residentadvisor</a>.\\nWas man aber unbedingt gemacht haben muss, ist eine der Skybars zu besuchen.</p>\\n<h6>Moonbar <a href=\\\"http://4sq.com/fQMu3V\\\" class=\\\"icon fa-foursquare\\\"></a></h6>\\n<p>Die Moonbar befindet sich im 61 Stockwerk des Banyan Tree Hotel und bietet einen atemberaubenden Blick über die Stadt.\\nAm besten fährt man mit einem Uber dort hin, da man so auch direkt am Eingang im Hinterhof abgesetzt wird.\\nAuf dem Rooftop befinden sich ein Restaurant mit Bar. Ein Mojito kostet ca. 500 THB dazubekommt man zu jedem Getränk Snaks.\\nMan sollte nicht zu Berliner Zeiten dort aufkreuzen, da die letzte Runde 00:30 Uhr sein wird.\\nNatürlich solltet man auch in angemessener Kleidung erscheinen!</p>\\n<h3>Where to sleep?</h3>\\n<p>Es gibt unendliche viele Übernachtungsmöglichkeiten es lohnt sich wie immer zu vergleichen und Bewertungen zu lesen.\\nIch nutze dafür Booking, Trivago, Airbnb und Skyscanner.</p>\\n<h6>Loftel 22 Hostel <a href=\\\"http://4sq.com/1c9Okx1\\\" class=\\\"icon fa-foursquare\\\"></a></h6>\\n<p>Ein Hostel, das ich sehr empfehlen kann! Es bietet nicht nur Schlafsäle, sondern auch Einzelzimmer.

Wenn ihr euch auf 75 % des ursprünglichen Fahrpreises einigt, habt ihr eine angenehme Fahrt handelt ihr ihn auf 50 % wird die Fahrt etwas riskanter :)\\nScheut euch auch nicht einen neues Tuk-Tuk anzuhalten, wenn der erste Fahrer nicht mit sich handeln lässt.</p>\\n<h6>Tipp:</h6>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Meiden sollte man Tuk-Tuks in der Rushhour (7:00-9:00 &amp; 16:00-19:00).</li>\\n<li>Ein Thai hat uns gesagt, dass man einfach Phæng Phai sagt, wenn einem der Preis zu teuer.

Nach Anfrage beim Support hieß es, dass nur thailändische Kreditkarten akzeptiert werden.</p>\\n<p>Zusätzlich bietet True auch WIFI Hotspots an.

Auch der rest der Tempelanlage ist sehr schön.\\nDer Wat Arun liegt auf der anderen Seite des Chaophraya.
