#### 1. Unlimited 4G Internet

Taiwan is one of the last countries with unlimited mobile internet.
You can get a 30 days prepaid sim card and download 30 GB videos with 4G speed.
Also tethering and VoIP is allowed to use.
I never used any WIFI in coffee stores because I could use my Iphone in hotspot mode with my macbook.
This is also fasteer because in Taipei you have 4G (LTE) all over the city.

More informations you will find at <a href="http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Taiwan">"Prepaid Data Sim Card Wiki"</a>


#### 2. Uber safe

Its one of the safest cities I ever been! Also drunk in a dark street in the middle of the night you feel still safe.
People leave their phones on the table to save their seat in a Starbucks.

#### 3. You do not need a visa

As a german citizen you can stay in Taiwan up to 30 days without a need of visa.


#### 5. Many Coworking Spaces

I think the next big ideas will come from Taipei insted of Vally
I meet a lot of good people with interesting ideas.

At <a href="https://nomadlist.com/taipei-taiwan/places-to-work">Nomadlist</a> you find some of those Co-Working spaces.



#### 6. Cheapest connection to Southeast Asia

You can get a cheap flight mostly less then 100 â‚¬ to the most countries in Asia.
