In the last 5 years I worked in Berlin as a JavaScript & Node.js software engineer for [lieferando.de](https://www.lieferando.de).
The team was incredibly awesome and I think I will never be again in such a great team in my future life.  
They have a lot of interesting project and always adventures and a top cutting edge platform. But I quit my 9to5 job because I want to work remotely and travel the world.


<blockquote>Cutting edge lover & Javascript enthusiast</blockquote>

Why?<br/>
There are thousands of reasons ...
I always want to create an own small business.
As employee, I often struggled with moments like: “I would do that differently” or “I do not belief that this strategy will be successful”.

<blockquote>I can´t develop a product if I not 100% belief in it!</blockquote>

Further I have incredible luck to work location independent as a software engineer. So why should I work every day from 9 to 8 in the office? Instead, I could travel the world!
But all that glitters is not gold! Work and travel the same time isn't easy. A not working WIFI in a Hotel is harmless ...
That's why I want to share my experiences with you.
